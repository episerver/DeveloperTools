## Episerver Developer Tools - Developer Friendly Toolbelt

Starting from v3.5 EPiServer DeveloperTools package is distributed as expanded (no zip file) add-on.
Add-on is not zipped due to issue with Razor ViewEngine and web.config file (more details here - https://world.episerver.com/forum/developer-forum/Developer-to-developer/Thread-Container/2019/4/issue-with-razor-views-while-developing-custom-add-on/#204171).

NB! If you have installed EPiServer.DeveloperTools previously and upgrading to v3.5 or above - delete EPiServer.DeveloperTools.zip file!
